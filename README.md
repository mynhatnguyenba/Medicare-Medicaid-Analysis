# Medicare-Medicaid-Analysis
# **📌 Medicare & Medicaid Geographic Analysis**  
*Identifying high-density areas for healthcare services using data analytics*  

## **📍 Overview**  
This project analyzes Medicare and Medicaid enrollment data across the U.S. to pinpoint locations with a high concentration of beneficiaries. The goal is to help healthcare providers and policymakers identify underserved areas and improve resource allocation for allergy testing and serum-related services.  

## **📊 Data Sources**  
The analysis is based on publicly available healthcare data from:  
- 📌 [CMS Medicare Enrollment Data](https://data.cms.gov/)  
- 📌 [Census Bureau Health Coverage Data](https://data.census.gov/)  
- 📌 [Medicaid & CHIP Enrollment Data](https://www.medicaid.gov/)  

## **🛠️ Tools & Technologies**  
- **Python**: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **SQL**: Extracting and filtering relevant data  
- **Power BI / Tableau**: Creating interactive dashboards  
- **GitHub**: Version control and portfolio showcase  

## **📈 Key Findings**  
- **Top States for Medicare Enrollment:** [Insert states with highest beneficiaries]  
- **High Medicaid Coverage Regions:** [Insert key counties/states]  
- **Potential Underserved Areas for Allergy Testing:** [Highlight trends]  

## **📌 Visualizations**
